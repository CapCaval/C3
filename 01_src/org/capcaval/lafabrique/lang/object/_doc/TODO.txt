TODO 

- Finish the bin to object with list
- add pointer management. Now aggregated object can not be null.
- optimize size by using byte[] with unsigned value and bit values for pointer
- optimize performances with caches



list&array  ==> 3 bytes for size and pointer, max size 2^23
other Object ==> 1 byte for null pointer
primitive ==> nothing as it can not be null
